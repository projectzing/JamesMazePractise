# JamesMazePractise

Setup for debugging!!!

Generates maze randomly
Adds three characters and an exit to random parts of the maze
Press 'U' and then 'Y', the characters will now know what path to follow to get to the end
Hold 'P' and they will move through the maze to the exit

Messy code
Needs optimizing
Needs commenting

I'll work on a better version now and upload it when it's understandable
